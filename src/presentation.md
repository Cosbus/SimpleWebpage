My name is Claes. I work as an engineer and when I have some free time I study web programming. I like movement and physical excercise and I love to hike and ski. Every year me and a bunch of friends spend a week or two on a ski-trip in the north of Sweden or Norway. Looking up at a starlit nightsky in the darkness of the northern winter night can be a really profound experience.

I used to train and compete in brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) at a fairly high level. However, now that I am getting up there in age, coupled with the birth of my daughter a couple of years ago the training frequency has reduced considerably. BJJ is often described as human chess because of the large amount of techniques availible and the tactical game involved. For anyone wanting to experience mindfulness without explicitly aiming to achieve the actual mental state I can recommend BJJ.
