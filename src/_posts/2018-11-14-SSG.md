A static web site is a web site which is stored in a existing state and delivered to all users that request it exactly as it is stored. There is no user input functionality in a static web site. This can be compared to dynamic web sites which are generated from a web application as a response to each user request as they happen. A Static Site Generator (SSG) generates static web sites from content files (md, HTML, CSS/SCSS etc.). SSG:s are suitable for creating static sites where performance and security are paramount. This site has been generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
